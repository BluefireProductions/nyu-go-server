# Web Publication Streamer

This project is a proof of concept that takes an EPUB as an input and provides the following resources in HTTP for it:

- a [Web Publication Manifest](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/webpub-manifest) based on the OPF of the original EPUB
- resources from the EPUB (HTML, CSS, images etc.)

It is entirely written in Go using [Negroni](https://github.com/urfave/negroni). The server is automatically binded to HTTPS using an automatic Let's Encrypt certificate.

In addition to streaming an EPUB as a Web Publication, this project also embeds the [Web Publication Viewer](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/webpub-viewer) in order to read such publications.

##Usage

By default the server will use EPUB files included in the root directory.

##Live Demo

A live demo of the viewer is available at: https://proto.myopds.com/?manifest=true&href=https://proto.myopds.com/manifest/mobydick.epub/manifest.json

It's based on a [Web Publication Manifest](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/webpub-manifest) generated by the server at: https://proto.myopds.com/manifest/mobydick.epub/manifest.json
